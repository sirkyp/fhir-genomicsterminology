  "description": "\"The Sequence Ontology is a set of terms and relationships used to describe the features and attributes of biological sequence. SO includes different kinds of features which can be located on the sequence. Biological features are those which are defined by their disposition to be involved in a biological process.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Sequence Ontologies are provided as a resource to the biological community. They have the following obvious uses:\r\n\r\n* To provide for a structured controlled vocabulary for the description of primary annotations of nucleic acid sequence, e.g. the annotations shared by a DAS server ([BioDAS](http://www.biodas.org/documents/das2/das2_protocol.html), [Biosapiens DAS](http://www.biosapiens.info/page.php?page=das_portal)), or annotations encoded by [GFF3](http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml).\"\r\n\r\n* To provide for a structured representation of these annotations within databases. Were genes within model organism databases to be annotated with these terms then it would be possible to query all these databases for, for example, all genes whose transcripts are edited, or trans-spliced, or are bound by a particular protein. One such genomic database is [Chado](http://www.gmod.org/wiki/Chado).\r\n\r\n* To provide a structured controlled vocabulary for the description of mutations at both the sequence and more gross level in the context of genomic databases.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Sequence Ontology is part of [OBO](http://www.obofoundry.org/). It has close links to other ontology projects such as the [RNAO consortium](http://roc.bgsu.edu/), and the [Biosapiens polypeptide features](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=BS).\"\r\n\r\nThe content can be browsed [here](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/obob.cgi)\r\n\r\nThe content can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/SO-Ontologies)\r\n\r\nFor information on contributing, please see [here](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/SO-Ontologies#contributing)\r\n\r\nTo request a term or register feedback, see [here](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/SO-Ontologies/issues)",

Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA.

      "definition": "The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein. It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding."

RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous.

These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation."

The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA.

It does not mean that this is a RNA that will never be translated; it merely means that the user-selected gene annotation system was not able to give a coding sequence annotation. It could still code protein products and may have such annotations in future versions of gene annotation or in another gene annotation system. For example, BC039000 is regarded as ncRNA by ANNOVAR when using UCSC Known Gene annotation, but it is regarded as a protein-coding gene by ANNOVAR when using ENSEMBL annotation.\n\nIt is further clarified in the comments section as: ncRNA does NOT mean conventional non-coding RNA. It means a RNA without complete coding sequence, and it can be a coding RNA that is annotated incorrectly by RefSeq or other gene definition systems."

The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron to intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny.",
